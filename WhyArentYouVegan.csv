There's barely anything about meat in it, but I'll address them.


>The second study, published in October the journal PLoS ONE, examined the remains of a prehuman toddler who died from malnutrition about 1.5 million years ago. Shards of a skull found in modern-day Tanzania reveal that the child had porotic hyperostosis, a type of spongy bone growth associated with low levels of dietary iron and vitamins B9 and B12, the result of diet lacking animal products in a species that requires them. [10 Mysteries of the First Humans]

This is easy to address. The argument is that meat is a source of B9 and B12, therefore the fact that we need those nutrients means we're supposed to eat meat. [But these nutrients can also be found in vegetables, citrus fruit, beans, peas, lentils, and water.](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/folic-acid-foods/) So their argument, which frankly wasn't valid in the first place, isn't even applicable.

>The child was around the weaning age. So, either the child's mother's breast milk lacked key nutrients, or the child himself did not consume enough nutrients directly from meat or eggs.

101,dgh8q0r,"1. You're right I don't know where you source your food, but unless you're eating animals that died from natural causes you're contributing in some way to the death of another sentient life form.

2. Most people would feel bad upon seeing a domestic animal like a cat or dog suffer, and would never consider harming one themselves, but they don't stop to think twice about eating an animal. Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in ""animal rights"" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not ""put here"" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.

3. By purchasing a product produced by or from an animal you are contributing (financially) to factory farming and pollution. 
It is impossible for any rational person to intelligently deny the negative ecological fallout of industrial farming. The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans. The list of insults to the environment goes on and on and on.
And the causal links are straightforward: nitrous oxide, along with methane and carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change; the waste products from irresponsible farming practices pollute water sources and damage ecosystems; rainforests act as carbon sinks - natural and vital temperature regulators to keep the planet healthy - we need them.

141,dgfscsy,Don't things like eggs and milk count as animal products? You don't have to kill the animal to get those.,t1_dgfrt8z,True
142,dgfujmq,"The production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. This birth/lactation cycle must be repeated endlessly in order to sustain economic levels of milk production.

This leads to three inherent problems in dairy production (note: the stats used are from the United States, but these practices are common around the world):

1. Every drop of milk that a calf suckles from their mother is a drop that is not able to be collected by humans, and vice versa. The longer a calf stays with their mother, the more stressful it is for both of them when they are separated. On both small and large dairy farms, all calves are separated from their mother, usually within a day after birth.
 - 1 calf is separated every 3 seconds in the U.S.

2. Approximately half of the calves that are born are male. Male calves are useless to the dairy industry as they do not produce milk. These calves born to the dairy industry are sold to the meat industry to be raised and slaughtered for either beef or kept in pens so small they can barely move (exercise makes their meat less tender) and slaughtered at just 18 weeks of age for veal. The veal industry has been shrinking in the U.S., but the dairy industry is still the primary source of new veal calves.
 - 1 bull calf is born every 6 seconds in the U.S., and 1 in 8 of those will be slaughtered for veal

3. Milk production declines as cows age, and eventually it costs more to feed them than is returned in milk value. This usually occurs at around 5 years of age (after 3 birth/lactation cycles), yet a cow’s natural lifespan is 20 years. On both small and large dairy farms, spent cows are slaughtered for beef once they are no longer economically viable.
 - 1 dairy cow is slaughtered every 11 seconds in the U.S.


There is also the general mistreatment of livestock animals to consider. Here are just a few examples from the dairy industry.

I Like animal products: chocolate pudding, panna cotta, osso bucco, carpaccio.

To prevent Vit B 12 deficiency: http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-b12-deficiency-can-be-sneaky-harmful-201301105780 My health is allready bad as it is. 

I Had a long time iron deficiency: my doctor told me to keep eating red meat, preferrably as raw as possible, luckily I liked it a lot. Now I don't eat it anymore, because my iron levels are okay. 

Being vegan here is hell and for rich people: it's way pricier than eating meat, cookies are less expensive than fruits/vegatables AND availability is bad: in our supermarkets there are almost no vegan alternatives to meat (only 3 options in the biggest one) and when it comes to fruit we only have: apples, oranges, pears (when in season), banana, and kiwi. Half of the time the kiwi are so hard and unripe u can't eat them, strawberries taste like water and watermelons too. Same with tomatoes: they are never ever ripe, green, or taste like water, unless you spend 2 times more at specialised shop that only sells fruits and veggies (greengrocer's). I live in a country with a cold climate. The few times I went on vacation, I liked the fruits and veggies ripened by the sun a lot!!!! Breakfast was amazing. 

When U are poor and have no other choice to eat what's on your plate, U'll learn to appreciate what's lying on your plate: when I was little, my dad killed rabbits that he brought up on his own, turkey as well, chickens, and he once shot a pheasant out of the sky, plucked it, cooked it. Not saying I liked those lots, but hey. Never been much of a fan of wild meat. 

If I don't eat what's lying on the shelves, someone else will probably buy it. Won't save the animal anyway. Also: many people who work in the industry would lose their jobs and income if everyone turned vegan (which will never happen). Seeking jobs at the moment is allready quite hard. 

(Eating) Some vegatables/fruits/plant extracts, or the way they are produced/extracted are also bad for the environment: f.e. palm oil, avocado's. Look it up if u don't believe me. 

Eating vegan doesn't always equal eating healthy: in premade meals and vegan resto's/catering they sometimes add way too much sugar, salt, things are (pre)fried. 

And last but not least, also proven by science: plants also feel pain, when plucked, so yeah. ;) If you look at everything, U wouldn't be able to eat anything anymore really. ",t3_665cyg,False

And when someone buys dairy products with an “organic” or “humane” label, the cows were perhaps able to go outside for some of their life, but they were still artificially inseminated, kept pregnant their entire short lives, and were milked well beyond what was ever intended for their bodies naturally. Their calves were still taken away soon after birth, never to nuzzle their mothers or drink from their udders, or to frolic in a field. If the calves born to dairy cows are male, they are worthless to the dairy industry, and are sold at auction to be killed for veal, or perhaps for meat. If the operation is organic, sick and diseased cows languish untreated so the milk is not “tainted” with needed medications.

Enslaving another species for food we don't even need isn't humane or ethical. And no one is saying we would just stop overnight, the animals would still be cared for.

There's barely anything about meat in it, but I'll address them.


>The second study, published in October the journal PLoS ONE, examined the remains of a prehuman toddler who died from malnutrition about 1.5 million years ago. Shards of a skull found in modern-day Tanzania reveal that the child had porotic hyperostosis, a type of spongy bone growth associated with low levels of dietary iron and vitamins B9 and B12, the result of diet lacking animal products in a species that requires them. [10 Mysteries of the First Humans]

This is easy to address. The argument is that meat is a source of B9 and B12, therefore the fact that we need those nutrients means we're supposed to eat meat. [But these nutrients can also be found in vegetables, citrus fruit, beans, peas, lentils, and water.](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/folic-acid-foods/) So their argument, which frankly wasn't valid in the first place, isn't even applicable.

>The child was around the weaning age. So, either the child's mother's breast milk lacked key nutrients, or the child himself did not consume enough nutrients directly from meat or eggs.

555,dgh8q0r,"1. You're right I don't know where you source your food, but unless you're eating animals that died from natural causes you're contributing in some way to the death of another sentient life form.

2. Most people would feel bad upon seeing a domestic animal like a cat or dog suffer, and would never consider harming one themselves, but they don't stop to think twice about eating an animal. Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in ""animal rights"" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not ""put here"" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.

3. By purchasing a product produced by or from an animal you are contributing (financially) to factory farming and pollution. 
It is impossible for any rational person to intelligently deny the negative ecological fallout of industrial farming. The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans. The list of insults to the environment goes on and on and on.
And the causal links are straightforward: nitrous oxide, along with methane and carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change; the waste products from irresponsible farming practices pollute water sources and damage ecosystems; rainforests act as carbon sinks - natural and vital temperature regulators to keep the planet healthy - we need them.

And being indifferent to possibility you may be wrong on such a matter is a vice.

593,dgfujmq,"The production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. This birth/lactation cycle must be repeated endlessly in order to sustain economic levels of milk production.

This leads to three inherent problems in dairy production (note: the stats used are from the United States, but these practices are common around the world):

1. Every drop of milk that a calf suckles from their mother is a drop that is not able to be collected by humans, and vice versa. The longer a calf stays with their mother, the more stressful it is for both of them when they are separated. On both small and large dairy farms, all calves are separated from their mother, usually within a day after birth.
 - 1 calf is separated every 3 seconds in the U.S.

2. Approximately half of the calves that are born are male. Male calves are useless to the dairy industry as they do not produce milk. These calves born to the dairy industry are sold to the meat industry to be raised and slaughtered for either beef or kept in pens so small they can barely move (exercise makes their meat less tender) and slaughtered at just 18 weeks of age for veal. The veal industry has been shrinking in the U.S., but the dairy industry is still the primary source of new veal calves.
 - 1 bull calf is born every 6 seconds in the U.S., and 1 in 8 of those will be slaughtered for veal

3. Milk production declines as cows age, and eventually it costs more to feed them than is returned in milk value. This usually occurs at around 5 years of age (after 3 birth/lactation cycles), yet a cow’s natural lifespan is 20 years. On both small and large dairy farms, spent cows are slaughtered for beef once they are no longer economically viable.
 - 1 dairy cow is slaughtered every 11 seconds in the U.S.


There is also the general mistreatment of livestock animals to consider. Here are just a few examples from the dairy industry.

If they truly felt so strongly over it, they would 100% invest into food replacements, like Soylent or ideas similar. Purely just molecular and vitamin-based supplements for food.

There's barely anything about meat in it, but I'll address them.


>The second study, published in October the journal PLoS ONE, examined the remains of a prehuman toddler who died from malnutrition about 1.5 million years ago. Shards of a skull found in modern-day Tanzania reveal that the child had porotic hyperostosis, a type of spongy bone growth associated with low levels of dietary iron and vitamins B9 and B12, the result of diet lacking animal products in a species that requires them. [10 Mysteries of the First Humans]

This is easy to address. The argument is that meat is a source of B9 and B12, therefore the fact that we need those nutrients means we're supposed to eat meat. [But these nutrients can also be found in vegetables, citrus fruit, beans, peas, lentils, and water.](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/folic-acid-foods/) So their argument, which frankly wasn't valid in the first place, isn't even applicable.

>The child was around the weaning age. So, either the child's mother's breast milk lacked key nutrients, or the child himself did not consume enough nutrients directly from meat or eggs.

860,dgh8q0r,"1. You're right I don't know where you source your food, but unless you're eating animals that died from natural causes you're contributing in some way to the death of another sentient life form.

2. Most people would feel bad upon seeing a domestic animal like a cat or dog suffer, and would never consider harming one themselves, but they don't stop to think twice about eating an animal. Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in ""animal rights"" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not ""put here"" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.

3. By purchasing a product produced by or from an animal you are contributing (financially) to factory farming and pollution. 
It is impossible for any rational person to intelligently deny the negative ecological fallout of industrial farming. The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans. The list of insults to the environment goes on and on and on.
And the causal links are straightforward: nitrous oxide, along with methane and carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change; the waste products from irresponsible farming practices pollute water sources and damage ecosystems; rainforests act as carbon sinks - natural and vital temperature regulators to keep the planet healthy - we need them.

892,dgfujmq,"The production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. This birth/lactation cycle must be repeated endlessly in order to sustain economic levels of milk production.

This leads to three inherent problems in dairy production (note: the stats used are from the United States, but these practices are common around the world):

1. Every drop of milk that a calf suckles from their mother is a drop that is not able to be collected by humans, and vice versa. The longer a calf stays with their mother, the more stressful it is for both of them when they are separated. On both small and large dairy farms, all calves are separated from their mother, usually within a day after birth.
 - 1 calf is separated every 3 seconds in the U.S.

2. Approximately half of the calves that are born are male. Male calves are useless to the dairy industry as they do not produce milk. These calves born to the dairy industry are sold to the meat industry to be raised and slaughtered for either beef or kept in pens so small they can barely move (exercise makes their meat less tender) and slaughtered at just 18 weeks of age for veal. The veal industry has been shrinking in the U.S., but the dairy industry is still the primary source of new veal calves.
 - 1 bull calf is born every 6 seconds in the U.S., and 1 in 8 of those will be slaughtered for veal

3. Milk production declines as cows age, and eventually it costs more to feed them than is returned in milk value. This usually occurs at around 5 years of age (after 3 birth/lactation cycles), yet a cow’s natural lifespan is 20 years. On both small and large dairy farms, spent cows are slaughtered for beef once they are no longer economically viable.
 - 1 dairy cow is slaughtered every 11 seconds in the U.S.


There is also the general mistreatment of livestock animals to consider. Here are just a few examples from the dairy industry.

And when someone buys dairy products with an “organic” or “humane” label, the cows were perhaps able to go outside for some of their life, but they were still artificially inseminated, kept pregnant their entire short lives, and were milked well beyond what was ever intended for their bodies naturally. Their calves were still taken away soon after birth, never to nuzzle their mothers or drink from their udders, or to frolic in a field.

There's barely anything about meat in it, but I'll address them.


>The second study, published in October the journal PLoS ONE, examined the remains of a prehuman toddler who died from malnutrition about 1.5 million years ago. Shards of a skull found in modern-day Tanzania reveal that the child had porotic hyperostosis, a type of spongy bone growth associated with low levels of dietary iron and vitamins B9 and B12, the result of diet lacking animal products in a species that requires them. [10 Mysteries of the First Humans]

This is easy to address. The argument is that meat is a source of B9 and B12, therefore the fact that we need those nutrients means we're supposed to eat meat. [But these nutrients can also be found in vegetables, citrus fruit, beans, peas, lentils, and water.](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/folic-acid-foods/) So their argument, which frankly wasn't valid in the first place, isn't even applicable.

>The child was around the weaning age. So, either the child's mother's breast milk lacked key nutrients, or the child himself did not consume enough nutrients directly from meat or eggs.

1069,dgh8q0r,"1. You're right I don't know where you source your food, but unless you're eating animals that died from natural causes you're contributing in some way to the death of another sentient life form.

2. Most people would feel bad upon seeing a domestic animal like a cat or dog suffer, and would never consider harming one themselves, but they don't stop to think twice about eating an animal. Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in ""animal rights"" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not ""put here"" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.

3. By purchasing a product produced by or from an animal you are contributing (financially) to factory farming and pollution. 
It is impossible for any rational person to intelligently deny the negative ecological fallout of industrial farming. The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans. The list of insults to the environment goes on and on and on.
And the causal links are straightforward: nitrous oxide, along with methane and carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change; the waste products from irresponsible farming practices pollute water sources and damage ecosystems; rainforests act as carbon sinks - natural and vital temperature regulators to keep the planet healthy - we need them.

1095,dgfujmq,"The production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. This birth/lactation cycle must be repeated endlessly in order to sustain economic levels of milk production.

This leads to three inherent problems in dairy production (note: the stats used are from the United States, but these practices are common around the world):

1. Every drop of milk that a calf suckles from their mother is a drop that is not able to be collected by humans, and vice versa. The longer a calf stays with their mother, the more stressful it is for both of them when they are separated. On both small and large dairy farms, all calves are separated from their mother, usually within a day after birth.
 - 1 calf is separated every 3 seconds in the U.S.

2. Approximately half of the calves that are born are male. Male calves are useless to the dairy industry as they do not produce milk. These calves born to the dairy industry are sold to the meat industry to be raised and slaughtered for either beef or kept in pens so small they can barely move (exercise makes their meat less tender) and slaughtered at just 18 weeks of age for veal. The veal industry has been shrinking in the U.S., but the dairy industry is still the primary source of new veal calves.
 - 1 bull calf is born every 6 seconds in the U.S., and 1 in 8 of those will be slaughtered for veal

3. Milk production declines as cows age, and eventually it costs more to feed them than is returned in milk value. This usually occurs at around 5 years of age (after 3 birth/lactation cycles), yet a cow’s natural lifespan is 20 years. On both small and large dairy farms, spent cows are slaughtered for beef once they are no longer economically viable.
 - 1 dairy cow is slaughtered every 11 seconds in the U.S.


There is also the general mistreatment of livestock animals to consider. Here are just a few examples from the dairy industry.

In another sense, one could say it's hypocritical, because they feel life (animals in this case) shouldn't be killed to sustain other animals (humans); that it's cruel. So they don't consider plants to be valid forms of life? Plants aren't worthy enough to not kill and harvest in huge amounts to fuel their sustenance? Hypocrisy... If they truly felt so strongly over it, they would 100% invest into food replacements, like Soylent or ideas similar. Purely just molecular and vitamin-based supplements for food.

There's barely anything about meat in it, but I'll address them.


>The second study, published in October the journal PLoS ONE, examined the remains of a prehuman toddler who died from malnutrition about 1.5 million years ago. Shards of a skull found in modern-day Tanzania reveal that the child had porotic hyperostosis, a type of spongy bone growth associated with low levels of dietary iron and vitamins B9 and B12, the result of diet lacking animal products in a species that requires them. [10 Mysteries of the First Humans]

This is easy to address. The argument is that meat is a source of B9 and B12, therefore the fact that we need those nutrients means we're supposed to eat meat. [But these nutrients can also be found in vegetables, citrus fruit, beans, peas, lentils, and water.](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/folic-acid-foods/) So their argument, which frankly wasn't valid in the first place, isn't even applicable.

>The child was around the weaning age. So, either the child's mother's breast milk lacked key nutrients, or the child himself did not consume enough nutrients directly from meat or eggs.

1206,dgh8q0r,"1. You're right I don't know where you source your food, but unless you're eating animals that died from natural causes you're contributing in some way to the death of another sentient life form.

2. Most people would feel bad upon seeing a domestic animal like a cat or dog suffer, and would never consider harming one themselves, but they don't stop to think twice about eating an animal. Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in ""animal rights"" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not ""put here"" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.

3. By purchasing a product produced by or from an animal you are contributing (financially) to factory farming and pollution. 
It is impossible for any rational person to intelligently deny the negative ecological fallout of industrial farming. The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans. The list of insults to the environment goes on and on and on.
And the causal links are straightforward: nitrous oxide, along with methane and carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change; the waste products from irresponsible farming practices pollute water sources and damage ecosystems; rainforests act as carbon sinks - natural and vital temperature regulators to keep the planet healthy - we need them.

There's barely anything about meat in it, but I'll address them.


>The second study, published in October the journal PLoS ONE, examined the remains of a prehuman toddler who died from malnutrition about 1.5 million years ago. Shards of a skull found in modern-day Tanzania reveal that the child had porotic hyperostosis, a type of spongy bone growth associated with low levels of dietary iron and vitamins B9 and B12, the result of diet lacking animal products in a species that requires them. [10 Mysteries of the First Humans]

This is easy to address. The argument is that meat is a source of B9 and B12, therefore the fact that we need those nutrients means we're supposed to eat meat. [But these nutrients can also be found in vegetables, citrus fruit, beans, peas, lentils, and water.](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/folic-acid-foods/) So their argument, which frankly wasn't valid in the first place, isn't even applicable.

>The child was around the weaning age. So, either the child's mother's breast milk lacked key nutrients, or the child himself did not consume enough nutrients directly from meat or eggs.

1289,dgh8q0r,"1. You're right I don't know where you source your food, but unless you're eating animals that died from natural causes you're contributing in some way to the death of another sentient life form.

2. Most people would feel bad upon seeing a domestic animal like a cat or dog suffer, and would never consider harming one themselves, but they don't stop to think twice about eating an animal. Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in ""animal rights"" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not ""put here"" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.

3. By purchasing a product produced by or from an animal you are contributing (financially) to factory farming and pollution. 
It is impossible for any rational person to intelligently deny the negative ecological fallout of industrial farming. The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans. The list of insults to the environment goes on and on and on.
And the causal links are straightforward: nitrous oxide, along with methane and carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change; the waste products from irresponsible farming practices pollute water sources and damage ecosystems; rainforests act as carbon sinks - natural and vital temperature regulators to keep the planet healthy - we need them.

1415,dghismm,"Making up your mind doesn't necessarily mean you're right. You lack humility. No one really knows the moral status of these beings, but we have some reason to think they matter. (Otherwise why would you even try to do the right thing towards them.) 

If you don't know the moral status of some being, it's objectionable to take a moral risk and kill them anyway without a justifiable reason. This risk is morally hazardous. Going ahead and killing anyway shows an objectionable indifference to the real possibility that you may be greatly mistaken. And being indifferent to possibility you may be wrong on such a matter is a vice.

1416,dgh2ija,"I never quoted 51%. That number is inflated.

The [UN](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet) and the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) recognize the problem. Those put emmissions at around 15% purely from animal ag. That's more than all transportation and I'm not even touching on nitrogen runoff, deforestation and antibiotic resistance- all huge problems that are inherent to cattle industries.

>Human beings are suffering. I'm sure a starving third world child would jump at the idea of eating pork, beef or poultry. As well as laugh at the idea of not using animal products partially because you feel sorry for an animal. One point I can probably agree with you on would be that the corporate mass pro farming is unnatural. But hey, a lot of people to feed, even with vegans and third world citizens. It is what it is on that one.

Red herring. Though considering that most of our crops, usually grown in those countries, go to cattle you'd think those starving people would be grateful for you going vegan.",t1_dggyr5c,True

Never disagreed. Doesn't mean it is bad. Using medicine is unnatural. So this isn't an argument against veganism. 

>I just like different types of food too much to dedicate my diet to veganism; that's the more deciding facter

But do you think veganism is the right thing to do? For example, I can think that donating 50% of my wages to charity is the right thing to do, but I can still not do it due to my weak will etc. Is that how you feel with veganism?

>In another sense, one could say it's hypocritical, because they feel life (animals in this case) shouldn't be killed to sustain other animals (humans); that it's cruel. So they don't consider plants to be valid forms of life?

Vegans aren't against killing living things. Vegans are against killing sentient beings. Plants aren't sentient.",t1_dgfxuim,True
